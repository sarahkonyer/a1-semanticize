				<h2>What is Mozilla Drumbeat?</h2>
				<p class="intro">Drumbeat is a global community of innovators like you, building a more awesome web and world. Connect with others. Find great projects. Or share your own.</p>
				<p>Mozilla is all about shaping the future of the web for the public good. With Drumbeat, we’re moving beyond Firefox to build more things that make the web better, not just software. We're doing that by reaching out to new kinds of people – educators, filmmakers, journalists, scientists, artists – to work together on open projects and design challenges that build a better web and world. We did that with Firefox. Now we want to do it on a broader scale, with new projects and people like you.</p>

				<p>By connecting you with like-minded collaborators and projects. Our online community and project platform are all about enabling collaboration and "working in the open" on projects that build a better web and world. Drumbeat's web site makes it easy for you to:</p>
